Note that the follows table has an unusual arrangement: it has two foreign keys to the same table. Why?

-This is to establish a many to many relationship between users and followers. For example, a user can follow many users as well as a user can have many followers.
-This organizes the code more efficently as well by letting us keep track of followers between users within a seperate table rather than cramming all the code within the Users model itself


- How is the logged in user being kept track of?
We are using a global function in conjunction with the session

- What is Flask’s ***g*** object?
a global flask variable, allows us to access information within the session for example about our user.

- What is the purpose of ***add_user_to_g ?***
this fills in the g.user with all information about the user. Basically checkking if the user is currently logged in or not.


- What does ***@app.before_request*** mean?
This runs that code before any request in the application.
